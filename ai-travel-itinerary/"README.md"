# 🌍🧠 AI Travel Itinerary Generator

This Python script uses AI logic to generate a custom travel itinerary based on a destination and number of days. It's a creative example of how Python can simulate intelligent outputs using prompt-based logic and control structures.

## 🚀 Overview

You input your destination and trip duration, and the script returns a multi-day itinerary. It's a fun tool that blends creativity with programming, demonstrating functions, loops, and formatted output.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter:
   - A travel destination
   - The number of days for the trip  
2. The script loops through each day and generates a set of itinerary suggestions.
3. Each day includes:
   - Activities
   - Food/restaurant ideas
   - Optional extras like shopping or sightseeing

> *Note: This version does not use a real AI model or API. It simulates AI output with custom logic and content.*
