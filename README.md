# 🐍 My Python Projects

Welcome! This is a curated collection of Python projects I’ve created to learn, experiment, and build my developer portfolio. Each project explores a different real-world application—from weather dashboards and travel planning to data visualization.

These projects were built as part of my transition into tech from a career in academia. I'm particularly focused on **API integration**, **data handling**, and **user-friendly design**, and I enjoy building tools that solve real problems in clean, intuitive ways.

## 🔧 Skills Practiced

- REST API integration (OpenWeather, AI travel APIs, SHeCodes)
- Python fundamentals & file handling
- GUI development with Tkinter
- Data visualization with `matplotlib`
- Terminal formatting with the `rich` library
- CSV parsing and basic data processing

## 📌 Projects Included

1. **🧳 AI Travel Itinerary Generator**  
   Uses live weather data and an AI-based itinerary API to create custom trip suggestions in the terminal. Styled using the Rich library.

2. **📈 Data Visualization App**  
   Reads CSV population datasets and generates styled line charts to highlight trends using `matplotlib`.

3. **🌦 Interactive Weather GUI**  
   A Python/Tkinter desktop app that fetches and displays real-time weather data and 3-day forecasts from OpenWeather.

## 🚀 What’s Next

I’m continuing to deepen my skills in Python and web development, with a strong interest in APIs, automation, and user-focused tools. I'm currently seeking **remote, freelance, or internship opportunities (up to 20 hours/week)** where I can contribute while continuing to grow.

Thanks for visiting!
